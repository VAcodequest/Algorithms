# Algorithms
This particular repository contains python code from my learning experience. This contains everything I know about algorithms and everything I am currently learning.

◇ Binary Search: Searches a sorted array in O(log n) time by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
-
◇ Linear Search: Examines each element sequentially until the target value is located or the end of the array is reached.
-
◇ Jump Search: Advances by fixed intervals (√n) in a sorted array, then performs a linear scan within the identified block.
